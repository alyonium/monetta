  Run the full feature.json loop until every user story passes: plan each
  pending story, implement it, then run feature-json-step-review (fix
  findings). When the feature is complete, archive current-task into
  docs/completed-tasks and commit. Use when the user says orchestrate
  feature.json, run all user stories, or finish the current feature.

# Feature JSON Orchestrate

Drive `current-task/feature.json` from start to finish with one story at a time. Don't stop until it's done.

Important, don't overload your main context. Your job is simple orchestration between agents.

## Loop

1. Read `current-task/feature.json` and its `relatedSources`.
2. While any user story has `passes: false`:
   1. Pick the highest-priority pending story (lowest `priority` number among `passes: false`).
   2. **Plan** — run `feature-json-create-step-plan` for that story (subagent).
   3. **Implement** — run `feature-json-implement-step` with the exact story id and the plan (subagent).
   4. **Review + fix** — run `feature-json-step-review` on the story's changes. Get the review results and pass it to Implementation subagent so it can fix it  (subagent)

Steps 2.3 and 2.4 can run in the loop, until review agent confirm it's ok. Review subagent should not modify the code.

For steps 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 use subagents. It's a hard rule. 

## Archive when the feature is done

When every user story has `passes: true`:

1. Derive a short filesystem-safe kebab-case slug from `description`.
   - Keep it short (roughly 3–6 words). Example: `Task Status` → `task-status-feature`.
2. Ensure `docs/completed-tasks/` exists in the **project** repo (create if missing).
3. If `docs/completed-tasks/<slug>/` already exists, append `-2`, `-3`, … until unique.
4. Move the entire `current-task/` directory to `docs/completed-tasks/<slug>/` (preserve the tree: `feature.json`, `learnings.txt`, and any other files).
5. Commit in the project repo, e.g. `docs: archive completed task <slug>`.
6. Tell the user the archive path.
